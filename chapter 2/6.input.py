#  Input() function :-
 
#  If we want users to input numbers then we need to use input().  

a = int(input("Enter number 1 : "))
b = int(input("Enter number 2 : "))
print("Number 1 is : ",a)
print("Number 2 is : ",b)
print("Sum is : ",a + b)

# In input() we need to specify the data type we want to input from user.
# Like above program if we can't describe the int in a & b variable the program/python will autometically undertand 
# it was string so we need to specify that the number is int. 
# Like this :-
print("janvi" + "vachhani")

a = int(input("Enter number 1 : "))
b = int(input("Enter number 2 : "))
print("Number 1 is : ",a)
print("Number 2 is : ",b)
print("Multiplication is : ",a * b)
